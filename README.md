# Project-2-Runge-Kutta-FehlbergforODE

The runge-kutta method is utilized for solving initial-value problems of differentai lequations, it is an iterative method, in this assignment we specifally use the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method, to solve the ODE it uses a procedure to detemine if the proper step is used and at each step two different appromximations for the solution are made and compared.

To run:

-Ensure that all the neccsary packages are installed: scipy, numpy, math, and matplotlib

-Run the program to view results

-Make console is in fullscreen once the output is show to show the table in proper format
